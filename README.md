8 Bits - Parallel Port Manipulation
===================


Hey! This is a old java project that works together with a C extension to send signals to a computer parallel port and listen on a specific input.  The input signal reads a flag from a ultrasonic sensor and other inputs to turn on a generic switch. 

 There area other functions written in java 1.5 to turn on a web camera, read a code and send Text message to some cellphone numbers.

 Feel free to fork it and tweak it as much as you would like.
