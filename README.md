8 Bits - Parallel Port Manipulation
===================


Hey! This is a old java project that works together with a C extension to send signals to a computer parallel port and listen on a specific input.  The input signal read a flag from a ultrasonic sensor and other outputs where used to turn a generic switch and to turn on a pretty loud signal. 

 There is other functions written used java 1.5 to turn on a web camera, read a code and send Text message to some cellphone numbers.

 Feel free to fork it and tweak it as much as you would like, contact me if you need.
